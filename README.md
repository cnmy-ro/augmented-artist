# Augmented Artist
Exploring generative software 2.0 tools that extend an artist's creative capabilities  


## Vision of the project
An artificial neural extension to our biological neural network (the brain) to:
1. Serve as a learning tool to bridge the gap between (an often high) imaginative capability and (an often limiting) skill in using the creative medium. 
2. Allow creation of new forms of art.
