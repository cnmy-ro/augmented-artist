# Augmented Artist
Exploring generative software 2.0 tools that extend an artist's creative capabilities  


## Vision of the project
An artificial neural extension to our biological neural network (the brain) to help bridge the gap between (an often high) imaginative capability and (an often limiting) skill in using the creative medium. 


## Possible failure modes
An assumption here is that the imaginative capability and the skill level are independent of each other. This might be wrong. Maybe the two grow mutually within a person - i.e. improving the skill level can help achieve higher levels of imagination, which can in turn help improve the skill level at a higher rate.
